# Combinatorial functions

This section is about basic combinatorial functions that arise in the context of counting problems. Usually, there are indirect ways of counting—like closed formulas—instead of having to explicitly create the list of objects in question. More special combinatorial functions that count objects we have implemented (e.g. restricted partitions) are discussed in the respective sections.
